# UserManagementSystem-CRUD-

This project was my way of learning the React.js framework by implementing basic CRUD functionalityâ€”allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their data.

I used Python Flask, HTML, JavaScript, React, and CSS for this project.

Through this experience, I gained a solid understanding of the React framework, and I'm excited to apply this knowledge to larger and more complex projects!
